# Convocation Game design Ideas

This will be the documentation i'm going to be explaining my core Ideas for a Dark fantasy medieval card game, this file will be incremented throught all de development of the game, since I will have new Ideas for the game and probably the rules will be changed sometimes, this is just the start.

# Core game Ideas

My main Idea of the game was to create a medieval Dark fantasy PvP card game, the overall design of the game will be Inspired by "Fromsoftware" dark art style, the game will be a Fusion of mainly Hearthstone and Yu-Gi-Oh initially, but it will have elements from many different card games.

Some of the game Ideas include: 

- The game will be a 1v1 PvP turn-based game, each player will have a deck that consists of 40 cards;

- The players will choose from a collection of Heroes, each hero will have it's own deck, the decks will be based on medieval fantasy races, for example the goblin king Hero: 

<img src="goblin-king.webp" alt="goblin king hero examples" width="600px">

He will have a deck that consists on convoquing a lot of Goblins to the field, they will also be putting a lot of traps on the field to get the enemy off guard;

- The idea is to create a lot of decks for many different races, each race will have a really distinct playstyle;

- The Objective of the game is to kill the enemy hero, the heroes will have 100 health by default and the players will be convoquing creatures to attack the enemy hero, once the enemy hero life reaches 0, you win the game;

- The players will be matched on a battlefield, where they will convocate their
creatures and fight for their lifes, in the next section i will be explaining a little bit more of the game mechanics with a little sketch I did on "Skelidraw" website.

# Game Battlefield Idea

- DISCLAIMER: all the images for the cards and heroes were created using an IA called <a href="https://sora.chatgpt.com/explore">sora</a>, the prompts used for creating the images was something like this: 

<em>"make a card of the goblin king with 100 health, make him fat and use a darker fantasy art style, like the one used in fromsoftware concept arts"</em> 

some of the arts are just placeholders for now, and they are subject to change.
