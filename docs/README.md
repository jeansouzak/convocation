# Requirement and techincal documentations Structure

This is the folder where you will find every Requirement and technical documentation about our "Convocation" project, Every aspect of the game's documentation will have its own folder, I will be following with an explanation about every folder here and its content:

# "convocation-game-prototype"

Here will be a little sketch I did about the game, there is also a documentation explaining every component of the core game Ideas and its rules, this folder will be changed throughout all the development of game, since I will be incrementing the Game with new Ideas and more content.
