# Convocation Game rules

This will be the first edition of the Convocation game rulebook, this book will have several editions as the game development keeps going.

I will break the game rulebook into 3 sections: 

- General section: Here I will explain the core mechanics of the game, how the game plays, what the players can do on It, how the players interact with each other, etc..

- Creature Rules: This will include the explanation about the creatures, "what is a creature", "what does it do", "how it works", etc...

- Battlefield Rules: Here you will find some explanation about the battlefield and how It works, all its divisions, how it interacts with each other, etc...

# Game Rules

the game is a PvP 1v1 turn-based card game, each player will control a hero like this: 

<img src="goblin-king.webp" alt="Goblin king example" max-width="300px">

The Goblin king, every hero will have by default 100 health.

- Every hero will come with its own deck, the Goblin king for example will have a Goblin themed deck, the great majority of his deck will be goblin creatures;

# Objective

The objective of the game is to reduce the enemy's hero health to zero, the way the players do that is by summoning creatures to the battlefield;

- Each creature will have 2 stats by default, attack (represented by a sword behind a number on the left side of the card) and defense (represented by a shield behind the number on the right side of the card)

- Each creature will take 1 of the player's Convocations to put it on the field, this "Convocations" will be a limited resource that players will have 2 of them per turn (BY DEFAULT).

Example of a creature: 

<img src="goblin-warrior.png" alt="Goblin creature example" max-width="300px">

- He has 1 attack (represented by the sword) and 4 defense (represented by the shield)

- Each creature will only have 1 attack per turn (BY DEFAULT);

- If the creatures' defense reaches 0, it dies and the card leaves the field;
